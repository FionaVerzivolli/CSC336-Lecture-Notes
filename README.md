# CSC336H1: Numerical Methods

**Hours:** 24L/12T

The study of computational methods for solving problems in linear algebra, non-linear equations, and approximation. The aim is to give students a basic understanding of both floating-point arithmetic and the implementation of algorithms used to solve numerical problems, as well as a familiarity with current numerical computing environments.

**Prerequisite:** CSC148H1 / CSC111H1; MAT133Y1(70%) / ( MAT135H1, MAT136H1) / MAT135Y1 / MAT137Y1 / MAT157Y1, MAT223H1 / MAT240H1
Exclusion CSC338H5, CSCC37H3. 

**NOTE:** Students not enrolled in the Computer Science Major or Specialist program at A&S, UTM, or UTSC, or the Data Science Specialist at A&S, are limited to a maximum of 1.5 credits in 300-/400-level CSC/ECE courses.

**Breadth Requirements:** The Physical and Mathematical Universes (5)
